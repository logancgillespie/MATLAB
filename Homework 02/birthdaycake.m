function [ pieces ] = birthdaycake( total, people )
% Inputs  (2): - (double) The total number of pieces of cake
%              - (double) The number of people at your party
%
% Outputs (1): - (double) How many pieces of cake you will get
%
% Function Description:
%   You are having a birthday party for yourself, and are trying to predict
%   how many pieces of cake you'll get to eat by yourself. Write a matlab
%   function to do this for you! There are two inputs: the total number of
%   pieces of cake, and the number of people at the party. You know that
%   the cake will need to be divided evenly between all guests at your
%   party, including yourself, and that you want everyone to eat the same
%   number of pieces. Because of this, there might be a few pieces of cake
%   left over that could not be fairly distributed. These few pieces left
%   over will be yours to eat after everyone has left, so you will get all
%   of them.
%
% Example:
%   If there are 20 pieces of cake and 6 people at your party: 18 pieces of
%   cake will be distributed among the 6 people so that each person gets 3
%   (including yourself). This will leave 2 pieces of cake remaining from
%   the original 20, and you will also get these 2 pieces. So your output
%   in this case should be 5.
%
% Notes:
%   - You may find the floor() and mod() functions useful.
%
% Test Cases:
%
%       [forMe1] = birthdaycake(20,6)
%           forMe1 => 5
%
%      [forMe2] = birthdaycake(300,56)
%           forMe2 => 25

% Calculating the amount of pieces per person
numpieces = floor(total/(people));
% Determining how many pieces are left over
people1= total-(numpieces*people);
% Calculating the number of pieces you will get
pieces = people1+numpieces;

end
